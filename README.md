# Rider Demand Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## Executive Summary
Bluebikes experiences highly variable rider demand based on seasonality, day of week, and time of day, which directly affects staffing, bicycle distribution, inventory, and fleet maintenance planning. This project developed a machine learning forecasting model to accurately predict total rider count and support operational decision-making. After cleaning and engineering temporal features from the raw dataset, multiple models were developed and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Random Forest (Bagging), and a Stacking Ensemble.

The stacking model achieved the strongest performance, reducing forecasting error by over 90% compared to baseline and improving RMSE from 181.54 riders to 68.26 riders. These improvements enable Bluebikes to better balance bike availability across stations, optimize logistics, reduce rebalancing costs, and improve customer experience by minimizing stockouts and excess inventory. This model can be used to support daily demand forecasting, seasonal planning, and staffing allocation.
